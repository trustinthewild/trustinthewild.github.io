1. Sign-up feature
- seems working good
- After click "Create Account", Firebase Authentication and Firebase realtime db are updated,
but the account emailVerified = false. At this time user can not sign-in. => good
- After click verification link => still the account emailVerified = false in Firebase realtime db.
But user can sign-in at this time. After user sign-in, account emailVerified = true.

- In the moment right after clicking "Create Account" button, the email address is displayed
in the username-button?
